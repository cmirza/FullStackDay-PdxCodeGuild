Capstone Proposal
=================

### Product Name

- **FreshPoint**

### Project Overview

The goal of the project is to take a user's zip code to find the state they're closest to, then provide a list of produce in that state that is currently season

### Functionality

1. Landing page with text box for zip code entry
2. View finds which state they're closest to
3. View gathers all produce for that state
4. View filters list by current season using current date
5. Data is displayed to user as grid of items with images and description
6. When user clicks on item, a detail view is given with complete season data for the user's state and map view of states in which the item is grown

### Data Model

- Primary model of vegetables
    - many to many relationship with states
    - **issue:** not sure where season months is kept

#### Sources

- NRDC Local Food Systems (https://www.nrdc.org/issues/local-food-systems)
