Capstone Proposal
=================

### Product Name

- Local Nature
- Fresh Finder

### Project Overview

The goal of the project is to take a user's zip code then reference a database of fresh produce with zip codes each plant is grown in and time of year it's in season for that area. The point of the project is to advise users on what produce to buy that can be locally sourced.

### Functionality

1. Landing page with text box for zip code entry
    - Either static definition of local (250mi) or allow user to choose radius
2. View sorts all zip codes within specified radius from user's zip code
3. View finds all produce applicable for list of zip codes
4. View filters produce by seasonality using current date
5. Data is sorted by distance to user's zip code
6. Data is displayed as a list to user
7. Pass list to map API and plot it on a map displayed to user

### Data Model

- Primary model of Zip Codes
    - many to many relationship with individual produce
    - Produce model has in season dates
    
- For calculating distance between zip codes (http://code.activestate.com/recipes/393241-calculating-the-distance-between-zip-codes/) 

#### Sources

- USDA
    - USDA Census of Agriculture
        - issue: data is county level
- FDA
- _Issue:_ Contacted OSU, PSU & UofO dept. of Agriculture for assistance in finding data sources
