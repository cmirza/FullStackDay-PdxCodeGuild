Capstone Proposal
=================

### Product Name

- Local Nature
- Fresh Finder

### Project Overview

The goal of the project is to take a user's zip code to find their county then reference a database of produce with counties each plant is grown in and time of year it's in season. The user will the receive a list of all the produce available to them within a specified radius. The point of the project is to advise users on what produce to buy that can be locally sourced.

### Functionality

1. Landing page with text box for zip code entry and finds their county
2. View sorts all counties within specified radius from user's county
3. View finds all produce applicable for list of counties
4. View filters produce by seasonality using current date
5. Data is sorted by distance to user's zip code
6. Data is displayed as a list to user
7. Pass list to map API and plot it on a map displayed to user
